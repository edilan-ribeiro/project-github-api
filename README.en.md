## About The Project

<img src="./src/images/readme/desktop.gif" alt="page on large desktop" width="350" height="320">

<br>

This project allows user data search on github and returns valuable information such as name, bio, followers, image and repositories data.

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software to communicate and interact with each other efficiently. They are essential for modern application development, especially when it comes to building complex and scalable services.

### Challenges and lessons learned


ðŸ—¨ Inserting data via javascript using HTML tags instead of just putting the text in the ready-made HTML element was certainly a new addition to this dev's utility belt.


ðŸ“± When the code was ready I deleted a repository and to my surprise things stopped working! This allowed me to catch an error that was unexpected by the code until now.

When a repository is recently deleted from github the API keeps reporting the repository deleted in recent activity, but it does not report its events, as the event message depends on reading the array in ```repoEvent.payload.commits[0].message``` the code stops running.

To solve this problem it is necessary to identify the existence of the array BEFORE trying to read it, like this:
<br>

``` 
repoEvent.payload.commits?.[0]?.message ?? 'âš  NÃ£o hÃ¡ mensagem de commit!'

```



ðŸ˜µ The API documentation is slightly confusing and leads to a new problem, repositories that were made by a fork and where no commit was made don't return information about the programming language used when a programming language was clearly used, in addition to that the api does not distinguish between repositories with programming languages and repositories with readme only.

In summary, I was able to learn:

- Inserting HTML tags through JavaScript
- Division of responsibilities does not always go as planned
- Libraries and frameworks can help a lot in certain functions (although they have not been used here)
